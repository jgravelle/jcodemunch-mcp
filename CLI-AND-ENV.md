# CLI Subcommands and Env Vars — the derivable half

The derivable half of `CLAUDE.md`'s **CLI Subcommands** and **Env Vars**:
what each subcommand and variable *does*. Rotated out on 2026-08-31 under
Maintenance Practice 5, verbatim.

⚠⚠ **This file is NOT loaded into a session, and that is the point.**
`jcodemunch-mcp --help` and `jcodemunch-mcp config` answer most of it live,
and `src/jcodemunch_mcp/config.py` holds every default — which is why it can
leave the always-loaded budget without losing anything.

⚠⚠ **The invariants did NOT move.** Every subcommand and variable whose
entry states a prohibition, a constraint whose violation causes a defect, or a
rationale keeps its full row in `CLAUDE.md` and is DELIBERATELY ABSENT here.
Nothing is duplicated between the two files:
`tests/test_cli_env_split.py` fails if a row appears in both, or in neither.

⚠ So a row missing from this file is not undocumented — it is documented in
`CLAUDE.md`, because what it needed said was worth a session's context.

⚠ User-facing configuration guidance lives in `CONFIGURATION.md`, which
documents 18 of these variables in prose form. That overlap predates this
split and is not resolved by it.

## CLI Subcommands
| Subcommand | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| `serve` (default) | Run the MCP server (`stdio`, `sse`, or `streamable-http`) |
| `init` | Interactive one-command onboarding: detect MCP clients, write config, install CLAUDE.md policy, hooks, index |
| `install <agent>` | (v1.105.1) Per-agent shortcut over `init`; targets: `claude-code`, `claude-desktop`, `cursor`, `windsurf`, `continue`, `all`. `install --list` enumerates; `install --status` reports state (JSON via `--json`). **v1.107.0:** `--skills` also emits the Claude Agent Skill bundle (`~/.claude/skills/jcodemunch/SKILL.md` by default; `--skills-scope project` for project-local) |
| `install-status` | (v1.105.1) Read-only report of which clients / policies / hooks currently have jcodemunch wired; `--json` for scripting. **v1.107.0:** also reports `skills.global.present` and `skills.project.present` |
| `watch <paths>` | File watcher — auto-reindex on change |
| `watch-claude` | Auto-discover and watch Claude Code worktrees |
| `watch-all` | Auto-discover **every** locally-indexed repo and keep it fresh; rediscovers on interval |
| `watch-install` | Install `watch-all` as a login service (systemd / launchd / Task Scheduler) |
| `watch-uninstall` | Remove the installed `watch-all` login service |
| `watch-status` | Print service state + per-repo reindex status (also exposed as MCP tool `get_watch_status`) |
| `hook-event create\|remove` | Record a worktree lifecycle event (called by Claude Code hooks) |
| `index [target]` | Index a local folder (default: `.`) or GitHub repo (`owner/repo`). One command, no init required |
| `index-file <path>` | Re-index a single file within an existing indexed folder (used by PostToolUse hooks) |
| `import-scip <path.scip> [--repo <id>]` | (v1.108.96) Ingest a SCIP index file (compiler-verified cross-references from scip-typescript / scip-python / scip-java / scip-go / rust-analyzer; .gz accepted) into the scip_* tables. Hand-rolled protobuf reader, no deps. `find_references` then tags `compiler_verified` refs + appends compiler-only refs. Cap via `JCODEMUNCH_SCIP_MAX_ROWS`. |
| `config` | Print effective configuration grouped by concern |
| `config set <key> <value>` / `config unset <key>` | (v1.108.51) Write/clear a config key in the global config.jsonc (typed, comment-preserving, validated; `--json` for tooling) |
| `config --check` | Also validate prerequisites (storage writable, AI pkg installed, HTTP pkgs present) |
| `config --upgrade` | Add missing keys from current template to existing config.jsonc, preserving user values |
| `download-model` | Download bundled ONNX embedding model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) for zero-config semantic search; `--target-dir` override |
| `install-pack [id]` | Download and install a Starter Pack pre-built index; `--list` for catalog, `--license KEY` for premium |
| `hook-pretooluse` | PreToolUse hook: steer Read/Grep/Glob/leading-Bash-search toward jCodemunch inside indexed repos (reads JSON stdin) |
| `hook-posttooluse` | PostToolUse hook: auto-reindex files after Edit/Write (reads JSON stdin) |
| `hook-taskcomplete` | TaskCompleted hook: post-task diagnostics — dead code, untested symbols, dangling refs (reads JSON stdin) |
| `hook-subagent-start` | SubagentStart hook: inject condensed repo orientation for spawned agents (reads JSON stdin) |
| `whatsnew` | Refresh README recency block + write `whatsnew.json` from `CHANGELOG.md` (release flow) |
| `digest` | Agent stand-up briefing — composes since-last-session delta + risk surface + dead-code candidates; tracks per-repo last-seen SHA at `~/.code-index/digest_state/`; also exposed as MCP tool `digest`. v1.108.68 adds a one-line retrieval-regret summary when the ledger has clusters |
| `delivery` | (v1.108.69) Print durable-change delivery metrics for a window — `delivery [repo] [--window-days N] [--rework-horizon-days N] [--cost DOLLARS] [--json]`. Thin CLI over `get_delivery_metrics`; `--cost` prints the headline cost-per-durable-change (how much got done for how little). Read-only git archaeology |
| `parity` | (v1.108.111) Map migration parity between two symbol trees — `parity <source> <target> [--source-path P] [--target-path P] [--match-threshold F] [--divergence signature\|signature+body\|name_only] [--no-rename] [--no-port-plan] [--json]`. Thin CLI over `get_parity_map`: ported/diverged/unported/orphaned/added counts + dependency-ordered port plan. Read-only/plan-only |
| `health` | Print `get_repo_health` JSON to stdout (includes six-axis radar). For CI/scripting; `--radar-only` for just the radar sub-field. Used by the v1.88.0 health-radar GitHub Action |
| `file-risk` | Print per-symbol risk JSON for a file (composite score + four-axis breakdown). Used by the v0.2.0 VS Code risk-density gutter |
| `observatory build\|init` | Public OSS code-health observatory pipeline — clones, indexes, scores a configured repo list; writes static HTML + RSS + JSON to an output dir. v1.90.0; CI repo-id bug fixed in v1.90.1. Live at https://jgravelle.github.io/jcodemunch-observatory/ |
| `org-report` / `org-rollup` | (v1.108.38/39) Team SKU: record this seat's savings under its org / aggregate across seats. `org-rollup` is the licensed feature (v1.108.42 gate). |
| `license` | (v1.108.42) Check jCodeMunch license status — `license [--key KEY] [--json]`; reports licensed / evaluation / unlicensed, tier, trial days left. Gates `org-rollup` only. |
| `surface` | (v1.108.154) Print the tool-surface schema receipt (same block `get_session_stats` reports as `tool_surface`) — surface/profile, visible vs catalog counts, schema tokens, avoided, heaviest schemas. `--json` for tooling (the Console's Tool surface cost card shells it). Scans nothing. |

## Env Vars
| Var | Default | Purpose |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `CODE_INDEX_PATH` | `~/.code-index/` | Index storage location |
| `JCODEMUNCH_SKIP_MSBUILD_OUTPUT` | 1 | (unreleased) Prune `obj/`/`bin/` when a .NET project file (`.csproj`/`.vbproj`/`.fsproj`/`.sln`/`.slnx`) sits BESIDE them (config key `skip_msbuild_output`). The project-file marker exists for `bin/`, which holds committed hand-written entrypoints in Node, Ruby and Go projects — a name-only rule would delete real source. Counted as `msbuild_output` in `discovery_skip_counts`, NOT a withheld reason, so absence stays citable. Only an explicit `false` disables it. |
| `JCODEMUNCH_SKIP_NUGET_PACKAGES` | 1 | (unreleased) Prune a `packages/` dir proven to be a NuGet restore tree by a child dir holding `<Id>.<Version>/<Id>.<Version>.nupkg` (config key `skip_nuget_packages`). The artifact marker is the design: `packages/` is hand-written source in Flutter, Dart and JS monorepos, so a name-only rule deletes real code, and loosening it to "child looks like `<Id>.<SemVer>`" keys on a naming convention rather than on evidence the writer left. Measured over 36 `packages` dirs: 26 prune / 10 keep, zero false positives. Where a `.gitignore` already lists `packages` this changes which rule excluded them and not what is indexed (measured: zero file difference); it moves the corpus only where no such entry exists (9286 → 7091, 1322 → 750). Two test-pinned false negatives, both erring toward indexing: a v2 tree with `.nupkg` files stripped, and the v3 global cache which nests one level deeper. The probe is bounded at 100 child dirs. Counted as `nuget_packages`, NOT withheld. Only an explicit `false` disables it. |
| `JCODEMUNCH_MAX_INDEX_FILES` | 10,000 | File cap for repo indexing |
| `JCODEMUNCH_MAX_FOLDER_FILES` | 2,000 | File cap for folder indexing |
| `JCODEMUNCH_FILE_TREE_MAX_FILES` | 500 | Cap for get_file_tree results |

| `JCODEMUNCH_SUMMARIZER_PROVIDER` | — | Explicit summarizer provider: `anthropic`, `gemini`, `openai`, `minimax`, `glm`, `openrouter`, `none` |
| `JCODEMUNCH_SUMMARIZER_MODEL` | — | Model name override for the selected summarizer provider |
| `JCODEMUNCH_EXTRA_IGNORE_PATTERNS` | — | Always-on gitignore patterns (comma-sep or JSON array) |
| `JCODEMUNCH_PATH_MAP` | — | Cross-platform path remapping; format: `orig1=new1,orig2=new2` |
| `JCODEMUNCH_STALENESS_DAYS` | 7 | Days before get_repo_outline emits a staleness_warning |
| `JCODEMUNCH_MAX_RESULTS` | 500 | Hard cap on search_columns result count |
| `JCODEMUNCH_HTTP_TOKEN` | — | Bearer token for HTTP transport auth (opt-in) |
| `JCODEMUNCH_RATE_LIMIT` | 0 | Max requests/minute per client IP in HTTP transport (0 = disabled) |
| `JCODEMUNCH_REDACT_SOURCE_ROOT` | 0 | Set 1 to replace source_root with display_name in responses |
| `JCODEMUNCH_SHARE_SAVINGS` | 1 | Set 0 to disable anonymous token savings telemetry |
| `JCODEMUNCH_REDACT_RESPONSE_SECRETS` | 1 | Set 0 to disable response-level secret redaction (AWS/GCP/Azure/JWT/etc.) |
| `JCODEMUNCH_STATS_FILE_INTERVAL` | 3 | Calls between session_stats.json writes; 0 = disable |
| `JCODEMUNCH_PERF_TELEMETRY_MAX_ROWS` | 100000 | Rolling cap on persisted perf rows; oldest rows trimmed in 1k-row batches once exceeded. |
| `JCODEMUNCH_RUNTIME_MAX_ROWS` | 100000 | (Phase 0) Per-repo cap on rows in runtime_* tables (ingested in Phase 1+); FIFO eviction in 1k batches once exceeded. |
| `JCODEMUNCH_CLIENT_ID` | basename(`sys.argv[0]`) | (v1.106.0) Friendly client name recorded in `process_locks` metadata. Auto-detected for common runtimes (claude, cursor, codex). Override for custom or wrapper runtimes so `get_watch_status.watcher_holder.client_id` surfaces a meaningful name to other processes. |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | — | Enables Claude Haiku summaries (`pip install "jcodemunch-mcp[anthropic]"`) |
| `GOOGLE_API_KEY` | — | Enables Gemini Flash summaries (`pip install "jcodemunch-mcp[gemini]"`) |
| `OPENAI_API_BASE` | — | Local LLM endpoint (Ollama, LM Studio) |
| `OPENAI_WIRE_API` | — | Set `responses` to use OpenAI Responses API instead of chat/completions |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | — | Enables OpenRouter summaries (default model: `meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:free`) |

| `GEMINI_EMBED_TASK_AWARE` | 1 | Set `0`/`false`/`no`/`off` to disable task-type hints (`RETRIEVAL_DOCUMENT` / `CODE_RETRIEVAL_QUERY`) when using Gemini embeddings |
| `JCODEMUNCH_CROSS_REPO_DEFAULT` | 0 | Set 1 to enable cross-repo traversal by default in find_importers, get_blast_radius, get_dependency_graph |
| `JCODEMUNCH_EVENT_LOG` | — | Set `1` to write `_pulse.json` on every tool call (per-call activity signal for dashboards) |
| `JCODEMUNCH_PARSE_CACHE` | — | Shared directory for the content-addressed parse cache (v1.108.40). Point all seats on a multi-home-dir box at the same path so identical files parse once across seats. Unset = disabled (no caching). |
| `JCODEMUNCH_PARSE_CACHE_MAX_ROWS` | 50000 | (v1.108.41) Row cap for the shared parse cache; FIFO-trimmed oldest-first by rowid after each write (stale-content/stale-version rows go first). `<= 0` disables the cap (unbounded). |
| `JCODEMUNCH_ORG_ID` | — | Org identifier for the team-SKU rollup (`org-report` / `org-rollup`) |
| `JCODEMUNCH_ORG_ENDPOINT` | — | Org host URL that `org-report` POSTs seat savings to (`/org/report`); unset = record locally |
| `JCODEMUNCH_ORG_INGEST_ENABLED` | 0 | Set 1 on the org host to accept `POST /org/report` (two-key turn with `JCODEMUNCH_HTTP_TOKEN`) |
